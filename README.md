# Matthew Roland Github Repository

This repository contains data analysis projects completed by Matthew Roland

Some of these projects were completed for academic credit from the CUNY School of Professional Studies M.S. Data Science program, others were completed as a part of my work as a Research Associate (dataset and variable names will be modified for privacy purposes when using code from my work as a Research Assistant; also, I will not be sharing the datasets, themselves, in order to protect participant privacy)
